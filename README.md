# Install all required PHP packages
composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev
```

#### 3. Database Infrastructure Setup
```bash
# Create database instance
mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE attendancemsystem CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"

# Import schema and initial data
mysql -u root -p attendancemsystem < "DATABASE FILE/attendancemsystem.sql"
```

#### 4. Configuration Management
Edit `Includes/dbcon.php` with your environment-specific credentials:
```php
<?php
// Database Configuration
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_USERNAME', 'your_username');
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_secure_password');
define('DB_DATABASE', 'attendancemsystem');
define('DB_CHARSET', 'utf8mb4');
?>
```

#### 5. Web Server Deployment
```bash
# Production deployment path
cp -r . /var/www/html/QIU-Student-Atendance/

# Development environment (XAMPP)
cp -r . C:\xampp\htdocs\QIU-Student-Atendance\
```

#### 6. Service Initialization
